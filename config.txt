rem vDos has some configuration options, you set them in this file.
rem Don't try to include DOS config.sys settings like KEYB=, that won't work!

rem Deactivate special keyboard handling necessary for XY3
rem If you need this, you would probably be better of uding the original vDos
rem KBXY3 = OFF

rem Deactivate rudimentary sound support for XY3
rem BEEPXY3 = OFF

rem Deactivate short file name support for long file names
rem SFN83 = OFF

rem Keyboard repeat delay in msec
rem KBREPDEL = 500

rem Keyboard repeat rate interval in msec, 0 disables repeat
rem KBREPINTER = 10

rem If you add this line to config.txt and - this is the really crucial part - 
rem you ALSO specify an external font like Consolas - then the C-cedilla will 
rem appear where you expect it to be. 
rem This will absolutely NOT work with the default internal vDos font, 
rem only with an external font that maps the C-cedilla and euro in the way that Windows expects.
rem Remember: euro = off will only turn off the euro if you use an external font, not the default built-in font. 
euro = off

rem put string of your choice in the title bar - of course only if you also use frame = on!
title = vDos - XyWrite 3

rem Uncomment to have a blinking cursor
blinkc = ON

rem This will put the specified icon at the upper left corner of the window.
rem icon = someiconfile.ico





REM Memory
REM ======
rem The first 64KB (low) memory is excluded.
rem If you need more than 575KB conventional memory. Caution, not all DOS programs can handle this:
rem LOW = ON

rem 160KB of upper memory (UMB) is available.
rem You can mainly use this for loading TSR's with LH/LOADHIGH. 

rem XMS (extended) memory is 63MB.
rem If your program cannot use XMS, but supports EMS (expanded) memory.
rem Convert all XMS to EMS 3.2, it will consume 64KB of UMB:
rem EMS = ON


REM Mouse
REM =====
rem In text mode the mouse is disabled.
rem Many DOS programs just handle the mouse badly, to turn it on:
rem MOUSE = ON


REM Window/font
REM ===========
rem Text is displayed using a built-in scalable TTF font.
rem If some extended ASCII (diacritic) characters display incorrectly, they are probably simply not defined in this limited font.
rem To use another (monospaced) TTF font, locate it in the Windows font folder and copy that file (consola.ttf...) to the vDos folder:
rem FONT = CONSOLA

rem ASCII codes 176-223 mostly display a mix of lines/boxes and extended characters.
rem If your application shows characters where you expect lines, force these to lines/boxes by the minus sign:
rem FONT = -[fontname]

rem The vDos window is lean and mean. No borders or title bar. Give it a try for some time to get accustomed to.
rem Hover over the top line, a minimize button will appear in the upper right corner.
rem Left click and drag the window to move it around.
rem No close button, you have to end your application to close the window.
rem If you don't like it and want the familiar Windows borders and title bar:
rem FRAME = ON

rem The vDos window will cover some (max) 75% of the screen.
rem To change this, use WINDOW = <max percentage>.
rem This would give you a full screen view (mind it's still a window and doesn't obscure Windows messages):
rem WINDOW = 100

rem The vDos window is centered on the screen.
rem To set it at another position, use WINDOW = <max percentage>, <left x-pos>:<top y-pos>.
rem Note: The window is ensured to be fully visible. If not, the x- and y-pos parameters are ignored.
rem WINDOW = 60,250:160

rem The number of lines/columns in text mode are the standard DOS 25/80.
rem You can changes this by LINS = <24..60> and COLS = <80..160>. 
rem See for yourself if this is useful or even supported by your application.
rem LINS = 30
rem COLS = 100

rem To use a different color scheme in text mode, supply all 16 color values in RGB: (r,g,b) or hexadecimal as in HTML: #RRBBGG.
rem The original DOS colors (first line is docu):
rem				0 - Black	1 - Blue	2 - Green 	3 - Aqua 	4 - Red 	5 - Purple	6 - Yellow 	7 - White 	8 - Gray	9 - Lt Blue		10 - Lt Green	11 - Lt Aqua	12 - Lt Red		13- Lt Purple	14 - Lt Yellow	15 - Bright White
rem COLORS =	#000000		#0000aa		#00aa00		#00aaaa		#aa0000		#aa00aa		#aa5500		#aaaaaa		#555555		#5555ff			#55ff55			#55ffff			#ff5555			#ff55ff			#ffff55			#ffffff
rem This would give you a gray scaled color scheme:
rem COLORS =	(0,0,0)		#0e0e0e		(75,75,75)	(89,89,89)	(38,38,38)	(52,52,52)	#717171		#c0c0c0		#808080		(28,28,28)		(150,150,150)	(178,178,178)	(76,76,76)		(104,104,104)	(226,226,226)	(255,255,255)
rem COLORS = MONO[,color scheme] selects a MDA card (with underline attribute). Though it doesn't work for all programs.

rem Scale the window in graphics mode: SCALE = <1..9> (that’s 100..900%).
rem It won't be that nice, One single point is simply enlarged to 2x2 points:
rem SCALE = 2


REM Printing
REM ========
rem LPT<1..9> and COM<1..9> are available for printing.
rem The program DOSPrinter by default handles printer output.
rem If nothing is set, it will pop up a Windows printer selection dialog as your application finished printing.
rem Note: Your application has to be configured to print to an Epson printer (the most widely used and emulated one).

rem Some examples, look at the DOSPrinter.pdf file for all options:
rem LPT1 = /SEL2 /CPIA /LEFT0.50 /TOP0.50
rem COM1 = /SEL /SEL2 /RTF /CPIA /LEFT0.75 /TOP0.75 /65
rem If your (DOS) printer is supported directly by your application:
rem LPT2 = /SEL'HPLaserJet2200' /RAW

rem Other options, not using DOSPrinter.
rem Just ignore the output:
rem LPT3 = DUMMY
rem Use a printer port to exchange data with the Windows clipboard:
rem LPT4 = CLIP
rem Open the printer output in Notepad:
rem COM2 = notepad #com2.txt
rem Run a Windows application hidden with the printer data (@ folowed by the Windows path to the program):
rem COM2 = @%windir%\system32\notepad.exe /p #com2.txt
rem If your (DOS) printer is supported directly by your application (/D:<Windows printer port>):
rem LPT1 = @%windir%\system32\print /D:LPT1 C:\vDos\#lpt1.asc 

rem If your application supports a PCL or PostScript (PS) printer:
rem Output to these printers is automatically detected, converted to PDF and shown in the default PDF reader.
rem For this to function the program pcl6.exe (PCL) or gswin32c.exe (PS) is required in the vDos folder.
rem You can download these at http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/ghostpcl.html (GhostPCL-W32-Binaries.zip).
